## Based on *nonblog*, a hugo theme created for this purpose.

*Nonblog* is based originally on ![Hello Friend NG](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/).

I just wanted a theme that I could use to create a static webpage with a background cover and hero images, but not all the "modern" extra functionality.  
I don't need blogs, comments, translations, tracking, or other nonsense. Just reasonably nice looking single pages and lists of subpages with information on them that I can easily update/maintain.

Added a few transparency options, optional hero images, and front page background options. Took out all the blogery.

I left in the light/dark theming in case I want it later, but set them both identically. I changed a few things to make the interface more responsive, but I don't really know what I'm doing. Seems to work ok.

I also pulled most of the styles and a lot of settings into the main Hugo config to be set globally, with per-page overrides on a lot of it.  
Still a work in progress, but I'm a little tired of working on it and it does what I want.

Only typing this up in case someone else comes across my use-case and is curious.

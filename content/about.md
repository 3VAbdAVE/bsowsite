The BackSide of Water Bar started as a little basement project during the pandemic. I figured if I couldn't get to my favorite tiki bars, I'd build my own.

## So it's a tiki bar?

More or less. I'd prefer to consider the theme an "Adventure", but no one knows what that means. If you say "tiki", people get it.

## Where is it?

Somewhere along the Nile river near the legendary Schweitzer Falls. Just follow the river for niles and niles and niles. If you still can't find it, well I guess you're in *denial*.

## So I can't visit?

No, probably not.

## Tiki is cringey appropriation

Historically? Yeah, definitely. These days there's a lot of us nerds trying to do better.

The boomer chuds over on [Tiki Central](https://tikicentral.com) certainly don't help with their reactionary denials, but I just try to be cool about how I represent stuff, and stick to a more intentional fantasy aesthetic based on tropical islands rather than claiming to actually represent anything real.

More importantly, I'm one dude with a basement bar. I'm not profiting off a whitewashed vision of island life. If I'm doing wrong, fine, but I'm pretty sure my impact is minimal.

## The name is a lame Disney Joke

Yeah. I'm over giving Disney more money, since they've got over offering any value for that money. But I'm hard into that Jungle Cruise/S.E.A./Indiana Jones/Johnny Quest adventure aesthetic.

I also think the phrase "Back Side of Water" makes a fantastic euphemism for booze.

## Why bother with a website?

I'm not selling anything, so weird, right?

There was a time when people just made websites for little things they were interested in. The internet used to be fun. That's all this is.

Anyway, I had an itch about getting to know modern HTML and CSS. I wanted to avoid big heavy frameworks like wordpress, or using invasive shitty corporate tools like Google, which eventually lead to discovering [Neocities](https://neocities.org) for hosting and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which was a perfect combination for what I want to do with this.
